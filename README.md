# C.Y.G.N.U.S AI

CYGNUS, the Cynical AI, combines snarky responses with uncanny aggression. (because JARVIS as a little piece of shit is the best headcanon ever!) Using Speech Recognition as user input, Cygnus can perform several simple tasks with a voice feedback.

Somethings Cygnus can do:
```python
# Web search
# Perform calculations through Wolfram Alpha
# Predict weather and time
# Search Youtube
# Search Wikipedia
# Search Google Scholar for school help
# Be a snarky talk-back chatbot
```


## System Requirements (install using pip)
CYGNUS works primarily on Python for now and requires the below mentioned imports to work:

```python
import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3
import wikipedia
import wikipediaapi
import time
import wolframalpha
import json
import requests
from newsapi import NewsApiClient
```
## In-built libraries:
Below mentioned libraries are pre-installed with Python but still need to be imported:

```python
import os
import datetime
import webbrowser
import subprocess
```

## Commands
Below is a list of some of the commands you can try giving the AI:

```python
"search Wikipedia" or "Wikipedia" to open Wikipedia API

"open YouTube" or "i want to watch YouTube" or "YouTube" to open YouTube 

"open Google" to open Google in the browser

"search google" to open search keyword in Google browser

"homework help" or "homework" or "help me with school" to open Google Scholar

"weather" or "how is the weather" to open Weather predictions for your city

"time" or "what is the time" to open time prediction

"news" to open Top News stories in browser

"calculate" or "math help" to open Wolfram Alpha for calculations

"log off" or "sign out" to shut down the program

```
Please also try talking to the AI, asking random questions beyond the normal tasks listed above.
